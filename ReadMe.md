# Revolutionising Anatomy Education with AR/VR

## Project Overview
Traditional anatomy learning relies heavily on static 2D diagrams and textbooks, making it difficult for students to visualize complex 3D anatomical structures. Limited access to cadavers and physical models further restricts hands-on learning. This project aims to address these challenges by providing an interactive AR/VR-based anatomy learning solution.
The application overlays 3D anatomical models onto 2D textbook images using augmented reality, enabling better conceptual clarity, engagement, and self-paced learning.

## Problem Statement
- Anatomy learning depends largely on static 2D diagrams
- Students struggle to understand 3D spatial relationships
- Learning methods are mostly passive
- Physical anatomical models and cadavers are limited
- Existing digital tools lack meaningful interaction

## Proposed Solution
This project presents an AR-based anatomy learning application where a 2D textbook image acts as a marker. When the camera detects the image, a corresponding 3D anatomical model is displayed on top of it. Users can interact with the model by rotating, zooming, and exploring it layer-by-layer.

## How the System Works
1. A 2D textbook image is used as an AR marker  
2. The device camera detects the image  
3. A 3D anatomical model is overlaid on the image  
4. Users interact with the model in real time  

## Key Features
- Interactive 3D visualization of human organs  
- Rotate and zoom functionality  
- Layer-by-layer anatomical exploration  
- Beginner-friendly and intuitive interface  

## Technology Stack
- Unity (Student Version)  
- Vuforia SDK  
- Android Platform  
- Free/Open-source 3D anatomical models
